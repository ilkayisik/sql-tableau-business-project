# sql-tableau-business-project
This repository contains scripts containing queries to extract data from a sql database.

In the repo you will find the following files:

file-name-01.sql: here are the queries for exploring the data.
file-name-02.sql: other-file: here are the queries to solve the business questions to answer whether it is a good idea for ENIAC to expand into the Brazilian market.

Explain what you did in more detail.
In this project we worked with the Magist dataset. 

The Project had one main question: Should Eniac expand it's business to Brazil or not. 
After exploraring the database with MySQL we created visualizations with Tableau.
